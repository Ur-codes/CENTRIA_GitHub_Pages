  <h1>Story</h1>
  <p>
    Once upon a time, in the enchanting land of KOKKOLA, there lived a mischievous little gnome named Jasper.
    Jasper was no ordinary gnome. While his fellow gnomes were content with their quiet lives in the village,
    tending to their gardens and fixing gnome-sized houses, Jasper had an insatiable curiosity and an adventurous spirit.
  </p>
  <p>
    One sunny morning, as the birds chirped and the flowers bloomed, Jasper woke up with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
    He had heard rumors of a legendary treasure hidden deep within the mystical Whispering Woods. Unable to resist the allure of adventure,
    he set off on his quest, equipped with his trusty walking stick and a map he had acquired from an ancient gnome scholar.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Jasper ventured into the Whispering Woods, the trees seemed to whisper secrets, and the wind carried the scent of mystery.
    But the journey was not without its challenges. He encountered mischievous woodland creatures that played tricks on him,
    making him lose his way more than once. Yet, undeterred, Jasper pressed on, using his wit and cleverness to overcome each obstacle in his path.
  </p>
  <p>
    Days turned into weeks, and Jasper found himself deeper and deeper in the heart of the forest. The trees grew taller, and the air grew thinner.
    Finally, he reached a clearing where a magnificent waterfall cascaded into a crystal-clear pool. According to the map,
    this was the spot where the treasure was said to be hidden oizjfzeijfzôefpojefêsjfeofje.
